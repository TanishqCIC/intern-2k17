   As  a  process  executes,  it  changes  state.  The  state  of  a  process  is  defined  in
   part by  the current activity  of that process.  Each process may be  in one of the
   following  states:
   •  New. The process is being created.
   •  Running. Instructions are being executed.
   •  Waiting.  The process  is  waiting  for  some  event  to  occur  (such  as  an  I/O
   completion or reception of a signal).
   •  Ready. The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
   •  Terminated. The process has  finished execution.
   These names are arbitrary, and they vary across operating systems. The states
   that  they  represent  are  fotind  on  all  systems,  however.  Certain  operating
   systems  also  more  finely  delineate  process  states.  It  is  important  to  realize
   that  only  one  process  can  be  running  on  any  processor  at  any  instant.  Many
   processes may be ready and limiting, however. The state diagram corresponding
   to these states is presented in Figure 3.2.
